# Data-Science-Lab-Project
Linking Italians' financial literacy and their need for financial services
 Financial literacy is an important topic that
 offers a picture of people’s knowledge about basic financial concepts. In this project we want to
 investigate on financial literacy and other struggles with other financial instruments across the
 general public. To do so,we are going to use
 the data coming from the OECD International
 Network on Financial Education enriched with
 the ones obtained by a research conducted by
 Banca d’Italia. This questionnaire has a very
 similar structure to the surveys that banks submit to their clients when opening an account,
 this makes it very suitable for this kind of research.We want to provide useful insights for
 banks and other financial businesses that want
 to investigate the socio-demographic aspects associated with the different financial attitude and
 knowledge of Italian people. In particular,our
 focus is set on financial literacy and the impact
 that it has on the way the client manages his
 money.
